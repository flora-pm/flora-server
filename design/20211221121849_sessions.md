# Sessions

This document is the reference for the behaviour of sessions and how they are handled.

At present time, distinction is made between:

* User sesions, where informations related to registered users in the system are persisted in the database.
* Browser sessions, where informations related to browsing the website are stored in a signed cookie.

## Cookies

Cookies are signed, and contain two entries

* SessionId: Only used for authenticated users, SessionIds are stored in database and link to "critical" data that shouldn't live in a cookie.
* Template data: Used to add interactivity to web pages across requests. Typically in order to display banners when something fails, but
  not only. We can avoid using them when sending a response. For example, if a form contains bad input data, the banners can be filled when
  responding to the request, no need for a redirect + template data.

Cookies have a TTL, but will also be invalidated by the server if the browser hasn't done any clean-up.

## Database sessions

Database sessions are used to persist user metadata across browsing sessions. Their primary keys are not the SessionId.
