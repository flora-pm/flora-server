In Flora, packages are categorised in a namespace to mark their provenance. They start with a `@` and allow us to refer to packages unambiguously or mark their importance.

## @haskell Packages

Some packages are foundational to the ecosystem and maintained by either the Core Libraries Committee or the GHC team, and this makes them unique in terms of the expectations we have from them.

These packages live in the [`@haskell`] namespace to show that they are stable and reliable. Some example of packages are `base`, `text`, `bytestring`, and `mtl`.

## @hackage Packages

This is where most third-party packages live, which you will find on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org).

## @cardano Packages

Flora also indexes the [Cardano Haskell Packages (CHaP)][CHaP], an index of packages by the Cardano project.
These packages live under the [`@cardano`] namespace.

To use them in your own project, insert the following configuration in your `cabal.project` file:

```
repository cardano
  url: https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-haskell-packages
  secure: True
  root-keys:
    3e0cce471cf09815f930210f7827266fd09045445d65923e6d0238a6cd15126f

and run `cabal update`.
