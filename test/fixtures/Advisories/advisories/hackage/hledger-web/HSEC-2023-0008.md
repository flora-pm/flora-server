# Stored XSS in *hledger-web*

An issue was discovered in *hledger-web* < 1.23. A Stored Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in `toBloodhoundJson` that
allows an attacker to execute JavaScript by encoding user-controlled
values in a payload with base64 and parsing them with the `atob`
function.

*hledger-web* forms sanitise obvious JavaScript, but not obfuscated
JavaScript (see [OWASP Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet][cheatsheet]).
This means *hledger-web* instances, especially anonymously-writable
ones like `demo.hledger.org`, could be loaded with malicious
JavaScript to be executed by subsequent visitors.
