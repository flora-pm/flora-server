# `readFloat`: memory exhaustion with large exponent

`Numeric.readFloat` takes time and memory linear in the size of the
number _denoted_ by the input string.  In particular, processing a
number expressed in scientific notation with a very large exponent
could cause a denial of service.  The slowdown is observable on a
modern machine running GHC 9.4.4:

```
ghci> import qualified Numeric
ghci> Numeric.readFloat "1e1000000"    -- near instantaneous
[(Infinity,"")]
ghci> Numeric.readFloat "1e10000000"   -- perceptible pause
[(Infinity,"")]
ghci> Numeric.readFloat "1e100000000"  -- ~ 3 seconds
[(Infinity,"")]
ghci> Numeric.readFloat "1e1000000000" -- ~ 35 seconds
[(Infinity,"")]
```

## In *base*

`Numeric.readFloat` is defined for all `RealFrac a => a`:

```haskell
readFloat :: RealFrac a => ReadS a
```

The `RealFrac` type class does not express any bounds on the size of
values representable in the types for which instances exist, so
bounds checking is not possible (in this *generic* function).
`readFloat` uses to `Text.Read.Lex.numberToRational` which, among
other things, calculates `10 ^ exponent`, which seems to take linear
time and memory.

**Mitigation:** use `read`.  The `Read` instances for `Float` and
`Double` perform bounds checks on the exponent, via
`Text.Read.Lex.numberToRangedRational`.


## In *toml-reader*

The issue was detected in *toml-reader* version 0.1.0.0, and
mitigated in version 0.2.0.0 by immediately returning `Infinity`
when the exponent is large enough that there's no reason to process
it.
