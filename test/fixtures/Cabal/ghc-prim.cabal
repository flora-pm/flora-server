    -- OS Specific
    if os(windows)
        -- Windows requires some extra libraries for linking because the RTS
        -- is no longer re-exporting them (see #11223)
        -- msvcrt: standard C library. The RTS will automatically include this,
        --         but is added for completeness.
        -- mingwex: provides C99 compatibility. libm is a stub on MingW.
        -- mingw32: Unfortunately required because of a resource leak between
        --          mingwex and mingw32. the __math_err symbol is defined in
        --          mingw32 which is required by mingwex.
        -- user32: provides access to apis to modify user components (UI etc)
        --         on Windows. Required because of mingw32.
        extra-libraries: user32, mingw32, mingwex

    if os(linux)
        -- we need libm, but for musl and other's we might need libc, as libm
        -- is just an empty shell.
